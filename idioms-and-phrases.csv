Little bit of heaven
Little piece of heaven
Little ray of sunshine
Make ends meet
Make the best of a bad situation
Man of few words
Many hands make light work
Mark my words
Miss the boat
Money talks
More than meets the eye
Mother knows best
Move heaven and earth
My cup of tea
My lips are sealed
My way or the highway
Make hay while the sun shines
Make a long story short
Man of his word
Method to his madness
Mind your own business
Missing in action
More bang for your buck
More the merrier
My way or no way
Make a mountain out of a molehill
Make a name for yourself
Man your own jackhammer

Money is the root of all evil
Mumbo jumbo
Mutually beneficial
My kingdom for a horse
Make a clean break
Make a killing
Man of action
Measure twice, cut once
Mind over matter

Monkey wrench
Much ado about nothing

My middle name
Make a long arm
Make a run for it
Man of his own accord
Master of ceremonies
Matter of fact
Mind boggler
Moment in the sun
Mopping up operations
Muddy the waters
My heart goes out to
Make a beeline for
Make a date
Man of his own destiny
Marked improvement
Matter of choice
Mind your p's and q's
Moment to moment
More power to
My bad
Make a long face
Make a quick buck
Man of his own mind
Matter of course
Minding one's own affairs
Moment of clarity
More than enough
My hands are tied
Make a bold move
Make a face
Man of leisure
Matters of the heart
Mental gymnastics
Mere trifle
Miles to go
My way or the high road
